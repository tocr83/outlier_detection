# outlier_detection

This project sets out to showcase how outlier detection can be done on a dataset, specifically here who are overcharged for insurance. 

Once detected, outliers can be investigated further, which we do not do here, we simply detect them.

We test out for different methods for outlier detection:
- Visualization
- Statistical method
- Distance based method
- Model based methods
